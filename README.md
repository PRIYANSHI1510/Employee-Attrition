# Employee-Attrition
A large company employs around 4000 employees. Every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on in order to curb attrition.  In this project we will analyse the datasets and build various models to best capture employee attrition.
